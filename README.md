## 🎯 Course Purpose

The course **ISIS3302 – Modeling, Optimization, and Simulation** provides students with the theoretical and practical tools needed to **formulate, analyze, and solve complex engineering problems** through mathematical modeling, optimization techniques, and simulation.

It focuses on:

* Building and validating mathematical models.
* Applying optimization methods (linear, nonlinear, and multi-objective).
* Using simulation to analyze dynamic and discrete-event systems.

By the end, students will be able to design **optimal and efficient solutions**, supporting informed decision-making in real-world engineering contexts.

## 🧠 Learning Objectives

Upon completing the course, students will be able to:

1. **Model real-world problems**, identifying variables, parameters, and constraints.
2. **Analyze and apply optimization methods**, both constrained and unconstrained.
3. **Understand and implement multi-objective optimization**, including heuristic and evolutionary algorithms.
4. **Design simulations of discrete-event systems**, applying results to engineering problems.
5. **Integrate modeling, optimization, and simulation** for solution comparison and validation.
